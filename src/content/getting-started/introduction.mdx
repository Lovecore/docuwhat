Welcome to **DocuWhat**, a modern documentation repository designed for organizing and presenting your technical documentation, tutorials, and resources in a clean and efficient manner.

## What is DocuWhat?

DocuWhat is a file-based documentation system built with Next.js and MDX. It provides a simple yet powerful way to create and manage documentation without the need for a database.

## Core Principles

### Simplicity First
We believe documentation should be easy to write and maintain. That's why we use Markdown files as the source of truth.

### Developer Experience
With hot reload, syntax highlighting, and familiar tools, creating documentation becomes a pleasant experience.

### Enterprise Ready
Despite its simplicity, DocuWhat provides all the features needed for enterprise-grade documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with DocuWhat:

1. Create your content in the `src/content` folder

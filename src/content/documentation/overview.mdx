# Welcome to DocuWhat Documentation

DocuWhat is a **file-based documentation system** that transforms Markdown files into beautiful, searchable documentation. No database needed - just create Markdown files and they become pages.

<Callout type="success" title="Key Insight">
  Every `.md` or `.mdx` file you create in `src/content/` automatically becomes a page with a URL matching its file path.
</Callout>

## How It Works

### 1. File-Based Routing

The magic happens through file-based routing:

<FileTree data={[
  {
    name: "src/content/",
    type: "folder",
    children: [
      { name: "about.mdx", type: "file" },
      {
        name: "guides/",
        type: "folder",
        children: [
          { name: "setup.mdx", type: "file" },
          { name: "advanced.mdx", type: "file" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]} />

This structure creates these URLs:
- `/about` ‚Üí from `about.mdx`
- `/guides/setup` ‚Üí from `guides/setup.mdx`
- `/guides/advanced` ‚Üí from `guides/advanced.mdx`

### 2. Frontmatter Metadata

Each file starts with frontmatter (YAML between `---` markers):

<CodeBlock language="yaml">
---
title: Your Page Title
description: Brief description for search and preview
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
video: "/videos/demo.mp4"
order: 1
updated: "2024-01-15"
---
</CodeBlock>

### 3. Rich Content with MDX

MDX lets you use React components in Markdown:

```markdown
# Regular Markdown

You can write **bold**, *italic*, and `code`.

&lt;Callout type="info"&gt;
  But also use React components!
&lt;/Callout&gt;

&lt;VideoPlayer src="/videos/tutorial.mp4" /&gt;
</CodeBlock>

## Core Features

### üîç Instant Search
Press `CMD+K` (or `CTRL+K` on Windows) to search all content instantly. The search indexes:
- Page titles
- Descriptions
- Content body
- Tags

### üåô Dark Mode
Toggle between light and dark themes with the moon/sun icon in the sidebar.

### üì± Responsive Design
Documentation looks great on all devices - desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### üéØ Auto-Navigation
The sidebar automatically generates from your folder structure. No configuration needed!

### üìä Table of Contents
Long pages get an automatic table of contents on the right side (desktop only).

## Quick Example

Create a new file `src/content/my-guide.mdx`:

```markdown
---
title: My Awesome Guide
description: This guide explains awesome things
tags: ["guide", "awesome"]
---

# My Awesome Guide

This is my content. It supports:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- `Code snippets`

&lt;Callout type="success"&gt;
  And special components!
&lt;/Callout&gt;

## Section 2

More content here...
```

Save the file, and visit `/my-guide` - your page is live!

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive titles** - They appear in navigation and search
2. **Add tags** - Makes content easier to find
3. **Set order** - Controls navigation sequence
4. **Include descriptions** - Shows in search results
5. **Update dates** - Helps users know content freshness
